# 24E-Dashboard-Gen-one

## Description

In this project, utilizing Altium Designer, I successfully engineered the driver dashboard for the '24E vehicle, which features an advanced integration of the STM32F405 series chip. The design includes LED matrices and LED decoders to provide clear, real-time visual displays. A buck converter is employed to ensure efficient power management, and various communication transceivers are incorporated to facilitate seamless data transmission across the vehicle's systems. The primary objective of this project was to enable the dashboard to display critical fault notifications from the Battery Management System (BMS) and the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU).
